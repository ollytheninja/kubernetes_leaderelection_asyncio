# Kubernetes Leader Election Asyncio

Cheeky copy-paste of the leader election code from the [Official Python client library for kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes-client/python) to make it compatible with it's [not so official asyncio counterpart](https://github.com/tomplus/kubernetes_asyncio).

This is for demonstration purposes only.
